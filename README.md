# ct-itmo-computer-design
Laboratory work for the first semester course on Computer Architecture, taught by P.S. Skakov at the CT Department of ITMO University.

## 1-st lab - counter & LFSR

You have to implement a counter and a linear feedback shift register using wires (better do this in the Logisim evolution application).

## 3-d lab - RISC-V disassembler

You have to implement disassembler for basic commands (you can even avoid privileged commands) of RISC-V ISA. Donâ€™t miss a couple of commands because they have tests for every command in the specification.
